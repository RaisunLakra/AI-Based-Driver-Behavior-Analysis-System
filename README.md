# 🚗 AI-Based Driver Behavior Analysis System

## 📚 Project Overview

The **AI-Based Driver Behavior Analysis System** aims to improve road safety by analyzing driving patterns and providing insights into driver behavior. This system leverages machine learning algorithms to detect risky driving habits, such as speeding or abrupt braking, and provides feedback to help drivers adopt safer driving practices. The solution can also be integrated with insurance companies to offer personalized insurance plans based on individual driving styles.

## 🌟 Features
- **🚦 Driving Pattern Analysis:** Detects common driving behaviors like speeding, sudden acceleration, and harsh braking.

- **⚠️ Risk Assessment:** Evaluates driver behavior and provides a safety score based on data analysis.

- **📊 Data Visualization:** Visual representation of driving patterns to help understand areas of improvement.

- **🤖 Machine Learning Integration:** Utilizes machine learning models to predict risky behaviors and offer real-time feedback.

## 💻Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** 🐍Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** 
  - `📊 Pandas` for data manipulation
  - `🔢 NumPy` for numerical operations
  - `🧠 scikit-learn` for implementing machine learning algorithms
  - `📈 Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization
- **Data Sources:** Publicly available datasets on driver behavior or simulated driving data

```

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
- Use the provided scripts to clean and preprocess the driving data.
- Load the dataset into the system for analysis.

2. **Run the analysis:**
```bash

python analyze_driver_behavior.py
```

3. **Visualize the results:**

- View the analysis results, including risk scores and driving pattern graphs.

## 📉 Data Visualization

The system provides interactive graphs and charts to represent driver behavior data. Visualizing data helps in understanding driving patterns and identifying areas for improvement.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- **📡 Real-time Data Integration:** Connect the system to real-time vehicle data using OBD-II devices.
- **🧬 Advanced Machine Learning Models:** Implement deep learning techniques for more accurate behavior predictions.
- **🤝 Integration with Insurance Providers:** Collaborate with insurance companies to offer personalized insurance plans based on driver scores.
