# AI-Based Driver Behavior Analysis System

## Project Overview
The AI-Based Driver Behavior Analysis System aims to improve driving pattern and providing insights into driver behavior.
This System leaverage machine learning algorithm to detect risky driving habits, such as speeding and abrupt breaking, and provide feedback to help 
driver to adopt safe driving practices.
The solution can also be integrated to insurance companies to offer personalised insurance plan based on individual driving style.
Using this we can also provide incentive and offer on services to user to follow traffic rules. This can increase vehicle life and performance which
will eventually help building trust between car owner and companies.

***NOTE:***
⚠️ Also we are neglecting the fact that a car can be own by multiple owner which can be solved using face detection and other technologies in future.


## Features
- **Driving Pattern Analysis:** Detects common driving behaviors like speeding, sudden acceleration, and harsh braking.
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluates driver behavior and provides a safety score based on data analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Visual representation of driving patterns to help understand areas of improvement.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilizes machine learning models to predict risky behaviors and offer real-time feedback.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** 
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` for implementing machine learning algorithms
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization
- **Data Sources:** Publicly available datasets on driver behavior or simulated driving data

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RaisunLakra/AI-Based-Driver-Behavior-Analysis-System.git
